## TIMING: Total ~120 seconds

---

### [0:00-0:10] INTRO (10 seconds)
**Visual:** Show title slide or desktop

"Welcome to the Crypto Market Dashboard. This is a real-time cryptocurrency market analytics application built with Node.js, Express, and CoinGecko's free public API. Let me show you what it can do."

### [0:10-0:35] LIVE DEMO - MAIN INTERFACE (25 seconds)
**Visual:** Open browser to http://localhost:3000 (or load balancer URL)

"Here's the dashboard. You can see the top 250 cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap. Each row shows the coin name, current USD price, 24-hour percentage change, market cap, and 24-hour trading volume."

**Click through a few coins**, scroll down to show data updating.

"All the data is fetched from CoinGecko API and cached on the backend to avoid rate limiting and improve performance."

### [0:55-1:20] INTERACTIVE CHART (25 seconds)

- Click on Bitcoin row
- Show chart appearing with smooth animation
- "This chart shows the price trend over the past week. You can see the price fluctuations in real time."

- Show new chart loading
- "Notice how the data is cached—subsequent requests are faster because we cache at the backend."

---

### [1:20-1:40] ARCHITECTURE & DEPLOYMENT (20 seconds)
**Visual:** Show directory structure or terminal

"Under the hood, the application is structured as follows:

**Frontend:** Single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript—no build process required. It handles all user interactions: search, filtering, sorting, and chart interactions.

**Backend:** Node.js Express server that proxies requests to CoinGecko and caches responses:
- 30-second cache for market data (to stay within rate limits)
- 5-minute cache for historical charts
- 24-hour cache for coin lists

**Deployment:** The app is deployed to two web servers (Web01 and Web02) and fronted by a load balancer (Lb01) running Nginx."

---

### [1:40-1:55] LOAD BALANCER TEST (15 seconds)
**Visual:** Terminal running curl commands

"Let's verify the load balancer is distributing traffic correctly."
- Run terminal command:
  ```bash
  for i in {1..6}; do curl -s http://LB_IP/api/whoami | jq '.hostname'; done
  ```
- Show alternating hostnames: Web01, Web02, Web01, Web02, Web01, Web02
- "As you can see, requests are being distributed evenly across both web servers."

---

### [1:55-2:00] CLOSING (5 seconds)
**Visual:** Show GitHub repo link

"The complete source code, including deployment scripts and configuration for the load balancer, is available on GitHub.

Key features:
✅ Real-time market data from CoinGecko
✅ Fast, responsive interface
✅ Secure API caching to avoid rate limits
✅ Scalable deployment with load balancing
✅ Zero external chart libraries (just vanilla JS and Chart.js)

Thank you for watching!"

## TECHNICAL NOTES:
- If CoinGecko is slow, the demo might lag. Have offline screenshots as backup.
- Ensure `.env` doesn't contain sensitive keys before recording (they won't appear anyway if using environment variables properly).
- Test all URLs (localhost:3000, LB URL, API endpoints) before recording.
- Use a simple screen recorder (e.g., OBS, ScreenFlow, built-in screen capture) for smoothness.
