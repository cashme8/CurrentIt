GITHUB PUSH INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Your Crypto Market Dashboard project is now ready to push to GitHub.

STEP 1: Create a GitHub Repository
===================================
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named "crypto-market-dashboard"
3. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

STEP 2: Get Your Repository URL
================================
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you the URL. It will look like:
https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-market-dashboard.git

STEP 3: Add Remote and Push
============================
Run these commands in the CurrentIt directory:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\LENOVO\OneDrive\Documents\New folder\summatives\CurrentIt"

# Configure Git (if not already done)
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Add remote origin (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-market-dashboard.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

STEP 4: Verify on GitHub
=========================
1. Go to your repository URL
2. Verify all files are there:
   - server.js
   - app.js
   - index.html
   - package.json
   - .env.example (not .env - it's in .gitignore)
   - README.md
   - deploy.sh
   - nginx-lb.conf
   - demo-script.txt
   - .gitignore

FILES PREPARED FOR DEPLOYMENT
=============================

PRODUCTION-READY:
- server.js (237 lines): Express backend with API proxy, caching, static file serving

- package.json: All dependencies specified
- .env.example: Template for environment variables
- .gitignore: Excludes node_modules, .env, sensitive files

DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION:
- deploy.sh (100+ lines): Automated setup for Web01 and Web02
- nginx-lb.conf: Load balancer configuration for Lb01
- README.md (600+ lines): Complete documentation without emojis, organized in sections

DOCUMENTATION:
- README.md: Comprehensive guide covering:
  - Features and tech stack
  - Quick start (local development)
  - Usage guide (search, filter, sort, charts)
  - API endpoints documentation
  - CoinGecko API information
  - Project structure
  - Deployment (automatic and manual options)
  - Testing procedures
  - Error handling

OTHER:
- demo-script.txt: 2-minute demo walkthrough script
- .gitignore: Proper exclusions for production

LOCAL TESTING PASSED:
=====================
✓ Server running on port 3000
✓ Node.js process active
✓ .gitignore created and configured
✓ All files organized (no subfolders per requirements)
✓ Git repository initialized
✓ Initial commit created with all files

NEXT STEPS AFTER PUSHING TO GITHUB:
===================================
1. Create GitHub repository and push code
2. Test deployment on Web01, Web02, and Lb01 servers
3. Record 2-minute demo video showing:
   - Local application running
   - Search/filter/sort functionality
   - Price chart interaction
   - Load balancer deployment
   - Traffic distribution
4. Update GitHub README with links to demo video
5. Submit GitHub URL and demo video link

IMPORTANT NOTES:
================
- .env file is in .gitignore (won't be committed) - good for security
- API keys are NOT in code - secure by design
- Code follows ES6+ standards and best practices
- All external APIs are properly credited
- Comprehensive error handling implemented
- Rate limiting strategy included in code
- Caching system reduces API calls

Your project is ready to deploy and submit!
